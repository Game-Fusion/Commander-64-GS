# Commander 64 Games System

The Commander 64 Games System is an all-new system inspired by the successful and innovative Commander 64. Its sole intention is to run games designed for Commander 64 and Commander 64 GS.

## Features:

- Minimalistic by nature; straight to the point, with no menus required!
- Support for Commander 64 games (and programs) as well as native titles
- Supports updating the console to new firmware revisions using an update disk and official install software
- Only 97 lines long!
- Support for advanced **and** monochrome computers!

And more!

## Why C64GS?

The C64GS allows developers to bring their games to a fully colour-enabled audience while automatically providing an experience for monochrome players with the automatic colour-to-monochrome wrapper!

Additionally, the C64GS allows you to develop games exclusively for the platform, *or* for the existing Commander 64 ecosystem! The C64GS is a hit with many users due to its straightforward nature, and running both C64 and native games/programs is a winning feature for the users. It is a platform that is very much back-to-basics and is a big hit among many users.

Developing games for the system is also incredibly uncomplicated; you make your game, name the executable as "run.gs" (or, if it is intended to be a C64 program, "run.c64") and place it on a disk! The benefit of using C64GS over C64 for games is the advanced computer support, allowing for colours to be used as well as including automatic monochrome support.

We hope users enjoy C64GS as much as we do!
