# Commander 64 GS Games

To put any of these games on a disk, simply download them and rename the game (eg. "laserblast.lua") to "run.c64" and place it at the root of a disk.

Note: The C64GS is only designed to have one disk in at a time, so be advised that it will check for /disk/run.c64, not disk2/ etc.
